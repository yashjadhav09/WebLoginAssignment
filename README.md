### Project Structure

```bash
.
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── style.css        # CSS for styling the page
├── script.js        # JavaScript for validation and API call
└── README.md        # This README file
```

### Running the Application
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. You should see the login form. Enter an email and password to test the functionality.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the login page.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styling for the login page.
- `script.js`: Includes all the JavaScript functionality for form validation, API calls, and interactive features.

## API Integration
This project uses JSONPlaceholder, a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping. The login form submits a POST request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`. 

**Note**: This is a simulation and does not perform actual authentication. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with a genuine authentication API.

## Customization
You can easily customize the look and feel of the login page by modifying the `style.css` file. The JavaScript functionality can be extended or modified in the `script.js` file.

## Browser Compatibility
This login page is designed to work on modern web browsers including:
- Google Chrome (latest)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Microsoft Edge (latest)

1. **HTML Structure**: Created a form with email and password fields, and a submit button.
2. **CSS Styling**: Applied professional styling with responsiveness for different screen sizes.
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: Implemented client-side validations for email and password.
